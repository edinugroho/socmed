Final task for #GenerasiGigih 2021

### Problem

You are tasked with developing a social media application which can be used to share information with other people. This application will only be used by people that work in a certain company so we cannot use existing public social media.

This is an API only application with the following stories:

 - As a user, I want to save my username, email, and bio description.
    - Authentication and authorization is out of scope of this story and you donâ€™t need to implement them
 
 - As a user, I want to post a text that might contain hashtag(s).
    - Maximum limit of a text is 1000 characters
    - A hashtag is a text that is followed by # symbol, for instance: #generasigigih
 
 - As a user, I want to see all posts that contain a certain hashtag.
    - A user can only filter by one hashtag at a time

 - As a user, I want to see the list of trending hashtags.
    - Trending hashtags are the top 5 most posted hashtags in the past 24 hours
    - A post containing multiple instances of a hashtag only counts as 1 occurrence for trending hashtags calculation

 - As a user, I want to comment on a post
    - A comment can contain hashtag(s)
    - A hashtag occurrence in a comment is counted in trending hashtags calculation
    
 - As a user, I want to attach things to a post
    - Three kinds of attachment are allowed: pictures (jpg, png, gif), video (mp4), and file (any other extensions outside of pictures and videos)
